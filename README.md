# Project Title

Customer Churn Analysis

## Description

This project aims to analyze customer churn and identify the features that contribute to customer attrition. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a company or service, and it can be a significant challenge for businesses to retain their customers. By studying customer churn, we can gain insights into the factors that drive customer attrition and develop strategies to mitigate it.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the collected data for analysis, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering if necessary.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory analysis to gain initial insights into the data, identify patterns, and visualize the distributions of various features.
- **Feature Selection:** Utilize statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify the most influential features that contribute to customer churn.
- **Model Building:** Develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to predict customer churn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the predictive models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Determine the importance of features in predicting customer churn using techniques like permutation importance or feature importance from tree-based models.
- **Reporting and Visualization:** Summarize the findings of the analysis through informative visualizations, reports, and presentations.
